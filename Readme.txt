Problem
India is one of the most populous countries in the world with over a billion people living . 
According to research from Maulana Azad Medical College in New Delhi, around 6.3 percent of the population (roughly 63 million people) have some level of functional hearing loss and can’t able to communicate.
These people have difficulty in communication with others and also can’t understand what other is saying. 
This creates language barrier hence creating problem of communication.Here sign language comes into the picture which helps in communication. 
But the problem is that not many people are aware of sign language and  also creates problem for the person who is deaf and can’t understand what others are saying. 
Person  every time needs a translator to understand the sign language.
